# Timeline Compute Times

[Back to Readme](../README.md)

## Description

For the active document, if it is a timeline design, export the feature compute times to a CSV file in a directory of your choice.

Rows/Features are sorted by compute time.

Rows include the component the feature applies to, the feature name, the time to compute in seconds and the health of the feature.

This tool is useful for identifying which features may be contributing unusual long times to model rebuilding.

## Access

Access to the **Timeline Compute** is from the Design Document's **Utilities** tab, In the **Tools** panel.
