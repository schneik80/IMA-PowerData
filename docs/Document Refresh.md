# Document Refresh

[Back to Readme](../README.md)

## Description

When working in a team it can be necessary to reload the active assembly to load new versions created by other team members.

In the file menu the Refresh command will automatically close, get new versions and then reload the active document, saving you time and nuisance of doing this manually. Fusion may show a yellow triangle on the get latest button in the QAT when a new version of the document is available. Having a separate command that can be run at will is a useful additional feature this command offers.

## Access

The **Refresh** command is accessed in a Fusion design document's **File** dropdown menu.
