# Document References

[Back to Readme](../README.md)

## Description

Display a dialog with detailed information on the active documents references. Useful to use standalone and more so with the [Related Data](/docs/Related%20Data.md) tool.


Four types of relationships are supported:

- **Parents** - Other documents that references the active document (where used). These would be incoming relationships.
- **Children** - Documents the active Document references (uses). These would be outgoing relationships
- **Drawings** - Drawings of the active Document.
- **Related Data** - Documents created with the [IMA PowerTools related data](/docs/Related%20Data.md) command. These are separated from other standard Fusion relationships making it easy to see discipline specific documents and not mixed with true design parent assemblies.

Documents are displayed as links. Links will open in Fusion team so long as the user has access and permission.

The Dialog title and each category displays a total number of references shown in parenthesis.

If no relationships exist, it will also be noted.

## Access

Access the **Document References** dialog in the **File** dropdown menu.
