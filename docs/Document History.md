# Document History

[Back to Readme](../README.md)

## Description

By default in Fusion, access to the active document's history can only be done by a right mouse click on the root of the browser. The Document History tool adds a QAT (Quick Access Toolbar) command entry to access the history in a more obvious and easy place.

## Access

Access to the **History** command is from the **QAT**.
