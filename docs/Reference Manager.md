# Document References

[Back to Readme](../README.md)

## Description

There are several different tools in Fusion to update a referenced document. These are spread out between the QAT (Quick Access Toolbar), the browser.

If you use nesting manufacturing workflows you may have used the Reference Manager to manage source documents for nest studies. If you are not familiar with this tool, you now can now access the Reference Manager outside of nesting for general document management workflows.

Reference Manager Dialog:

- Update all references
- Update one or select references independently
- Open a reference document to a new tab



## Access
