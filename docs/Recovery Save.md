# Recovery Save

[Back to Readme](../README.md)

## Description

Fusion offers a lesser know keyboard shortcut to force save a recovery point for the active document. This ensures that should a rare crash occur you can recover you work. When working in a team, controlling unnecessary saves from prompting others to get out-of-date references can help reduce change chatter, but making sure local work is not lost is also important. A recover save allows this.

A new file menu command is added to help make creating a recovery save easier rather than using the keyboard shortcut.

## Access

The **Refresh** command is accessed in a Fusion design document's **File** dropdown menu.
