# Get and Update

## Description

By default in Fusion you will see a yellow triangle on the QAT (Quick Access Toolbar) when child references are out of data. You my find that you have to click "Get all Latest" more than once using this default tool. You may also need to manually identify and update assembly contexts that need updating after getting latest references.

The Get and Update tool adds a QAT (Quick Access Toolbar) command entry to access a more reliable update for assembly references and contexts.

## Access

Access to the **Get and Update** command is from the **QAT**.
