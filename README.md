# Data Power Tools for Fusion 360 v0.1

Make working as a team and with model designs more productive.

Available Tools:

1. Data Refresh - When working in a team it can be necessary to reload the active assembly to load new versions created by other team members. Int he file menu the Refresh command will automatically close, get new versions and then reload the active document, saving you time and nuisance of doing this manually.

2. Autosave - This creates an entry in the file menu to manually save a local recovery save.

3. Get and Update - Typical x-ref assemblies will use assembly contexts to create associativity across parts. When new versions of x-refs are available one must load the new versions and then manually update the out of date contexts. Data Power Tools adds a QAT command to automatically get all latests and then update contexts.
